Social Data Science & Statistics
--------------------------------

We are a group of students, researchers, and faculty at <a href="http://stats-for-good.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a> and <a href="http://dlab.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley</a> exploring the potential to promote social good through effective data analysis. This site organizes our findings, and some resources we have found helpful.

We are actively seeking coordination with other research groups, data scientists, and domain experts. To get in touch, contact [Lester Mackey](mailto:lmackey@stanford.edu).
