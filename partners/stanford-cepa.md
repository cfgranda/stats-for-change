### About CEPA

On a high level, the problem CEPA cares about is: Which education policies should be implemented at the district/state/federal level?

- CEPA does causal inference, with the goal of such research affecting policy.
- CEPA consolidates data to make it more efficient for people to use; helps share/pool data across districts, which is otherwise difficult for them.
- CEPA has processes for getting access to data.

### Conversations

The Stanford working group [Statistics for Social Good](http://stats-for-good.stanford.edu/) has had multiple conversations with CEPA, primarily focussed on applying statistics to analyze data from very small school districts. For notes, email [Andreas Stuhlm√ºller](mailto:ast@mit.edu).
